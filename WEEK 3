#In this exercise you will create a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the user. If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message indicating that the entered letter is a vowel. If the user enters y then your program should display a message indicating that sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is a consonant. Otherwise your program should display a message indicating that the letter is a consonant.

#Most years have 365 days. However, the time required for the Earth to orbit the Sun is actually slightly more than that. As a result, an extra day, February 29, is included in some years to correct for this difference. Such years are referred to as leap years. The rules for determining whether or not a year is a leap year follow:
year = input()
y = int(year)
if y%400 == 0 :
